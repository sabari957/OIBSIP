# BMI Calculator

Objective:
To create a simple Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user based on their height and weight, and classifies the result into categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese.

Steps Performed:

1. Prompt the user to input height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).


2. Calculate BMI using the formula:



BMI = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2}

4. Display the BMI value and category to the user.



Tools Used:

Python 3.x (for program logic)

Basic input/output functions for user interaction


Outcome:
A working console application that quickly calculates BMI and provides health category feedback.



# Random Password Generator

Objective:
To generate a secure random password of user-defined length, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Steps Performed:

1. Ask the user for the desired password length.


2. Use Python’s string and random modules to define and shuffle possible characters.


3. Randomly select characters until the desired length is reached.


4. Display the generated password to the user.



Tools Used:

Python 3.x

string module (for character sets)

random module (for randomization)


Outcome:
A functional tool that generates strong, unpredictable passwords to enhance security.




# Text-Based Chat App

Objective:
To build a simple chat application using Python’s socket programming that allows two or more users to exchange text messages over a network.

Steps Performed:

1. Implement a server program that listens for incoming client connections.


2. Implement a client program that connects to the server.


3. Use socket functions to send and receive messages in real time.


4. Use threading to handle multiple clients simultaneously.


5. Run server and clients on the same or different machines to test communication.



Tools Used:

Python 3.x

socket module (for network communication)

threading module (for handling multiple clients)


Outcome:
A working text-based chat system where multiple users can communicate over a local or external network.
